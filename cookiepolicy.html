                <p>
                    Like many websites we use cookie and other similar technologies (“cookie”). A “cookie” is a piece of
                    information in the form of a small text file that is placed on a user’s hard drive. It is generated
                    by a web page server, which is basically the computer that operates a web site. The information the
                    cookie contains is set by the server and it can be used by that server whenever the user visits the
                    Website. A cookie can be thought of as the user’s identification card, which tell the Website when
                    the user has returned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cookies are not computer programs or codes, they are not used to transfer viruses. Modern versions
                    of browsers allow users to reject or opt out of receiving cookies as detailed below.

                    If you wish to delete any cookies that are placed on your computer, you may refer to the help and
                    support section in your internet browser. Modern browsers allow users to reject, delete or opt out

                </p>
                <h5 class="accentText mt-5 text-left">HOW LONG DOES A COOKIE STAY ON YOUR DEVICE?</h5>
                <p>
                    The length of time a cookie will stay on your computer depends on whether such cookie is a session
                    or permanent cookie.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4"><i>Session Cookie</i></p>
                <p>
                    Session cookie is usually stored as a session ID during the user’s browsing session and is not
                    personally identifiable. Session cookies are never written on the hard drive. When user completes
                    the session and closes the browser, these cookies are automatically deleted from the user’s
                    computer. Session cookies expire at the end of the user's browser session and can also become no
                    longer accessible after the session has been inactive for a specified length of time, usually 20
                    minutes.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4"><i>Permanent Cookie</i></p>
                <p>
                    Unlike session cookie, permanent cookie is stored on the user’s computer even after the user’s
                    browser is closed. Permanent cookies allow to remember user’s preferences to be used in the future
                    browsing sessions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By its nature permanent cookie can be used to identify individual users and analyse user’s surfing
                    behavior on the Website. They are usually stored for a prolonged period of time, in some cases many
                    years into the future.
                </p>
